    "### Introduction to Django Framework\n",
    "Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. It follows the “Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)” principle and emphasizes clean, reusable code.\n",
    "Django was created to help developers build web applications quickly without reinventing common functionality such as authentication, database handling, and URL routing."

    "### Key Features of Django\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ MVC / MVT Architecture\n",
    "Django follows the MVT (Model–View–Template) pattern, which is slightly different from the traditional MVC but achieves the same goal of separation of concerns:\n",
    "- Model: Handles database structure and data logic.\n",
    "- View: Processes requests and returns responses.\n",
    "- Template: Handles the user interface (HTML).\n",
    "- This separation makes applications easier to manage and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Built-in Admin Panel\n",
    "Django provides a powerful automatic admin interface that allows developers to:\n",
    "- Manage database records.\n",
    "- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
    "- Control users and permissions.\n",
    "- All without writing extra code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3️⃣ ORM (Object Relational Mapper)\n",
    "Django’s ORM lets developers interact with databases using Python code instead of SQL. This makes database operations:\n",
    "- Safer\n",
    "- Easier to read\n",
    "- Database-independent (Switch between SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL easily)\n",
    "- employees = Employee.objects.all().order_by('-created_at')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4️⃣ Security\n",
    "Django includes built-in protection against common security threats such as:\n",
    "- SQL Injection\n",
    "- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n",
    "- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n",
    "- Clickjacking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5️⃣ Fast Development\n",
    "With Django, developers can focus on application logic instead of low-level details. It provides \"batteries-included\" features like:\n",
    "- Authentication system\n",
    "- Form handling\n",
    "- Session management\n",
    "- URL routing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6️⃣ Scalability\n",
    "Django is used by large platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and Disqus, proving it can handle high traffic and complex systems effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Django\n",
    "- Open source and free\n",
    "- Written in Python (easy to learn and readable)\n",
    "- Large community support and ecosystem\n",
    "- Clean and organized project structure\n",
    "- Excellent documentation"
